# Database description
My wife currently lives in Japan, and when I graduate this year, I intend to look for employment in there, but with a lot of information scattered about, it is often difficult to know what to study, in terms of programming, and prepare for. I wanted it to be very friendly for foreigners that have difficulty understanding Japanese to plan about getting a job.

While anyone can view the contents of all the job postings in Japan, only admins and employers can add, edit, and delete job. Each user (Person) consists of a unique id, first name, last name, visa sponsor, user name, password, and language proficiency. Companies or admins can post (add), edit, and delete job posts, and those job consists of a unique id, job title, job salary, job location, job description, language, and resident only attrribute.
