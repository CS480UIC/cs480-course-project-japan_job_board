How does this draft meet the requirements of the assignment? If not, what is it missing?                                                                                                                                | 4. After seeing this, I was left wondering . . .                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Japan Job Board         | - The primary keys are well defined - The "is a" relationship is mentioned explicitly - The "Job" entity has a "resident_only" field and similarly the "Person" entity has a "update" relationship for profile update, which makes the application more like a real-time application.  | -  strong and weak entities are not mentioned -  weak relationships not identified - "Person" entity should have "language" property as multivalued.                                                                                                                                         | Yes                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | The project is quite well-defined and the ERD is very simple to understand even for someone who knows less about ERD.                                                                                                                                      |
| japan_job_board         | The cardinalities look good, all of the entities and attributes look good as well, and also the relationships are specific and I know what the idea of the project is.                                                                                                                 | Everything is kind of scattered all over the place so it is a little bit difficult to follow the relationships with all the lines. One of the entities "profile" doesn't have any attributes so I'm not sure what the profile does or has. Also, there are no data types for the attributes. | While this is a specific diagram, it does not look like it is in the logical design phase. Adding data types for the attributes needs to be added, and also there are some lines with cardinalities that look incomplete.  | This is a very interesting project, I would be curious to see how much it impacts people looking for jobs in Japan.                                                                                                                                        |
